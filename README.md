# Open Virtual Tissues (OpenVT)

## Background

OpenVT seeks to build an engaged community of researchers that use and develop open source multicellular modeling frameworks. These frameworks allow virtual experiments (simulations) of cell behaviors within tissues and organs. The goals of OpenVT are to:

* educate the community of users on the features that each framework offers, via
  - comparative spreadsheets of capabilities
  - links to documentation
  - publications that highlight the frameworks, with either specific models or more general background
* provide easier model sharing between frameworks
* provide steps toward model reproducibility between frameworks
* seek new funding opportunities related to this overall project

## Articles comparing frameworks
